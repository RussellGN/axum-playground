      Little Red Riding Hood is a young girl who wears a red hooded cloak. She is sent by her mother to visit her sick grandmother and bring her food. Along the way, she encounters a wolf, who tricks
      her into revealing the location of her grandmother's house. The wolf arrives first, eats the grandmother, and disguises himself as her. When Red Riding Hood arrives, she notices strange things
      about "grandmother," and the wolf eventually reveals himself. In some versions, a huntsman saves them both by killing the wolf.
